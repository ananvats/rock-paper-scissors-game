# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
### This is a very basic game that everyone knows how to play. Here, it is played between the user and the bot. Built with Vanilla JS, HTML5 and CSS. This project helped me polished my skills and learn some JavaScript functions that I didn't know how to implement. 

#### You already know the rules, but here they are:
<p>-> paper beats rock</p>
<p>-> rock beats scissors</p>
<p>-> scissors beats paper</p>


##### Happy playing!
